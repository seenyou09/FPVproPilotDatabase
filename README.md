# FPVproPilotDatabase

### **Introduction**:
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project focused on scraping data for Betafpv. The goal was to create a comprehensive database of professional FPV (First Person View) drone pilots within the emerging FPV drone racing scene. This activity combines elements of traditional sports and esports, as participants navigate drones through courses using first-person view goggles.

### **Objective**:
----
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betafpv requested the compilation of a database containing information about active FPV pilots across the United States, Europe, and Canada. Given the novelty of FPV drone racing, there was a lack of centralized platforms providing a list of pilots and their associated details. To fulfill this requirement, I leveraged Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape information from various FPV drone websites and their corresponding social media platforms.

### **Tools and Technologies Used**:
---
* Python: The primary programming language for this project.
* BeautifulSoup: A Python library for web scraping, enabling the extraction of data from HTML and XML files.
* FPV Drone Websites: Various sources were explored to collect information about professional FPV pilots.
* *Social Media Platforms: Pilots' social media profiles were scraped to gather additional details.
